# Build Cycle Fix - Complete Solution

## The Problem
Xcode is reporting a circular dependency (build cycle) between:
- The Runner target trying to copy app extensions
- The "Thin Binary" script phase
- The Info.plist processing

## Automated Fix (Running Now)
The Ruby script `fix_xcode_phases.rb` is reordering the build phases to resolve the cycle.

## Manual Fix in Xcode

### Step 1: Open Xcode
```bash
open /Users/amos/Documents/GitHub/flutter_wblock_plugin/example/ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

### Step 2: Fix Build Phases Order
1. Select **Runner** target
2. Go to **Build Phases** tab
3. Reorder phases by dragging them to this order:
   - ✅ Target Dependencies
   - ✅ [CP] Check Pods Manifest.lock
   - ✅ Compile Sources
   - ✅ Link Binary With Libraries
   - ✅ Copy Bundle Resources
   - ✅ [CP] Embed Pods Frameworks
   - ✅ Embed App Extensions
   - ✅ Thin Binary *(move this to the end)*
   - ✅ Run Script (Flutter Build)

### Step 3: Remove or Fix "Thin Binary" Script
The "Thin Binary" script might not be needed. You can either:

**Option A: Delete it**
- Click on "Thin Binary" phase
- Press Delete key

**Option B: Fix its dependencies**
- Click on "Thin Binary" phase
- Uncheck "Based on dependency analysis"
- Ensure "Input Files" and "Output Files" are empty

### Step 4: Clean and Build
1. **Product > Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Product > Build** (Cmd+B)

## Alternative: Disable Extensions Temporarily

If you need to test the Flutter app urgently:

1. In Xcode, select **Runner** scheme
2. **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme**
3. Go to **Build** tab
4. Uncheck all "wBlock" extension targets
5. Build and run

## Command Line Build After Fix
```bash
cd /Users/amos/Documents/GitHub/flutter_wblock_plugin/example
flutter clean
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
flutter build ios --simulator --debug
```

## Why This Happens
This issue occurs when:
- Build phases reference each other in a circular way
- Script phases have incorrect dependency settings
- Extension embedding happens at the wrong time in the build process

## Verification
After fixing, you should see:
```
✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED
```

Then run:
```bash
flutter run
```

## If Still Failing
1. Delete Derived Data completely:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
```

2. Reset the project:
```bash
cd ios
git checkout -- Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
pod deintegrate
pod install
```

3. Manually configure in Xcode as described above

## Status
- ✅ Ruby script executed to reorder phases
- ⏳ Pod reinstallation in progress
- ⏳ Flutter rebuild attempting

Check your Terminal for current status!
