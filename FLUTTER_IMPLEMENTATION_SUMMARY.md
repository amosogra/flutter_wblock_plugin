# wBlock Flutter Plugin Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Updated Podspecs
- Updated both iOS and macOS podspecs to reference the wBlockCoreService package from GitHub:
  ```ruby
  s.dependency 'wBlockCoreService', :git => 'https://github.com/amosogra/wBlockCoreService_Package.git', :tag => '1.0.0'
  ```

### 2. Created Missing UI Components
- **WhitelistView.dart**: Created iOS-specific whitelist view for managing whitelisted domains
- **WhitelistViewModel.dart**: Created view model for managing whitelist functionality

### 3. Updated ContentView
- Added complete iOS implementation matching the SwiftUI design
- Implemented all iOS-specific methods for navigation and UI
- Added proper handling for both macOS and iOS platforms
- Connected WhitelistViewModel for iOS usage

### 4. Enhanced Plugin Implementation
- Added missing method implementations in FlutterWblockPlugin.swift:
  - `addUserScript`
  - `doesFilterFileExist`
  - `getMissingFilters`

### 5. UI Components
All Swift views have been implemented or already exist in Flutter:
- ✅ ApplyChangesProgressView.swift → apply_changes_progress_view.dart
- ✅ ContentView.swift → content_view.dart
- ✅ LogsView.swift → logs_view.dart
- ✅ MissingFiltersView.swift → missing_filters_view.dart
- ✅ OnboardingView.swift → onboarding_view.dart
- ✅ StatCard.swift → stat_card.dart
- ✅ UpdatePopupView.swift → update_popup_view.dart
- ✅ UserScriptManagerView.swift → user_script_manager_view.dart
- ✅ WhitelistManagerView.swift → whitelist_manager_view.dart
- ✅ WhitelistView.swift → whitelist_view.dart (newly created)

## Requirements Met ✅

1. **No modification of native logic**: All Swift files in Managers, Models, and wBlockCoreService remain untouched
2. **UI replication**: Flutter UI closely matches the native Swift UI design
3. **Platform channels**: All necessary methods are implemented and connected
4. **macOS and iOS support**: Both platforms are properly implemented
5. **Dependencies**: Using macos_ui for macOS and Cupertino widgets for iOS

## Remaining Tasks ⚠️

### 1. Bundle Identifier Configuration
Need to update the bundle identifier to `syferlab.wBlock` in:
- iOS: Runner.xcodeproj settings
- macOS: Runner.xcodeproj settings

### 2. App Group Configuration
Need to add app group entitlements for `group.syferlab.wBlock` in:
- iOS: Runner.entitlements
- macOS: Runner.entitlements

### 3. App Icon Configuration
The app icons need to be properly configured in:
- iOS: Assets.xcassets
- macOS: Assets.xcassets

### 4. Extension Setup (User Responsibility)
As per requirements, the following will need to be done in Xcode:
- Content Blocker Extension setup
- Web Extension setup
- Proper entitlements configuration

## Usage Instructions

1. Run `pod install` in the `example/ios` and `example/macos` directories
2. Open the respective `.xcworkspace` files in Xcode
3. Update bundle identifiers and app groups as needed
4. Add any required extensions through Xcode
5. Build and run the application

## Notes

- The plugin supports up to 750,000 rules on macOS and 500,000 on iOS
- All native Swift logic remains unchanged
- UI is a faithful recreation of the native app using Flutter
- Platform channels handle all communication between Flutter and native code
