# Flutter wBlock Plugin - Progress Tracking Issues Fixed

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `_applyProgressData` Method
**Issue:** The `_applyProgressData` method was referenced but not implemented in `AppFilterManager`, causing progress data to not be properly processed.

**Fix:** Implemented the complete `_applyProgressData` method that:
- Updates all progress-related properties
- Properly handles category statistics parsing
- Ensures non-zero values aren't overwritten with empty data
- Includes comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Stream-based Progress Monitoring
**Issue:** The original implementation used polling with potential for missed updates and inefficient resource usage.

**Fix:** Implemented a proper stream-based progress system:
- Created `StreamController` for progress updates
- Added proper stream subscription management
- Implemented cleanup in dispose method
- Combined stream events with periodic polling for reliability

### 3. Sheet Management Issues
**Issue:** Multiple sheets were appearing to open/rebuild for each progress update, creating a poor user experience.

**Fix:** Added sheet tracking flags in `ContentView`:
- Track which sheets are currently showing with boolean flags
- Prevent duplicate sheet openings
- Ensure proper cleanup when sheets are dismissed
- Fixed the timing of sheet state updates

### 4. Category Statistics Display
**Issue:** Category statistics were not showing in the progress view.

**Fix:** Enhanced category statistics handling:
- Improved parsing of category data from native side
- Added proper `ParseFilterListCategory.fromRawValue` usage
- Enhanced debug logging to track category data flow
- Fixed the display logic in `ApplyChangesProgressView`

### 5. Dismiss Button Not Working
**Issue:** The dismiss button in the progress sheet wasn't functioning properly.

**Fix:** The dismiss button now works correctly because:
- Sheet state is properly managed
- No duplicate sheets are created
- Progress monitoring is properly canceled when sheet is dismissed

## Key Implementation Changes

### AppFilterManager Enhancements:
1. **Added Stream Management:**
   ```dart
   StreamController<Map<String, dynamic>>? _progressStreamController;
   StreamSubscription? _progressSubscription;
   Timer? _progressTimer;
   ```

2. **Implemented `_applyProgressData` Method:**
   - Properly parses and applies all progress data
   - Handles category statistics correctly
   - Prevents data loss by not overwriting with empty values

3. **Added Progress State Reset:**
   - `_resetProgressState()` method to ensure clean state before operations
   - Proper cleanup in `_cancelProgressMonitoring()`

4. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Try-catch blocks around progress fetching
   - Proper stream controller state checking

### ContentView Improvements:
1. **Sheet Tracking Flags:**
   ```dart
   bool _isShowingUpdatePopup = false;
   bool _isShowingMissingFiltersSheet = false;
   bool _isShowingApplyProgressSheet = false;
   // ... etc
   ```

2. **Duplicate Prevention:**
   - Check if sheet is already showing before opening
   - Properly update flags when sheets open/close

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test "Check for Updates":**
   - Should show proper progress with all 4 overall statistics items
   - Category statistics should display when available
   - Progress should complete and allow dismissal

2. **Test "Apply Changes":**
   - All statistics should be visible after processing
   - Dismiss button should work immediately
   - No duplicate sheets should appear

3. **Test Progress Updates:**
   - Progress bar should update smoothly
   - Stage descriptions should change appropriately
   - No UI flickering or rebuilding issues

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Better Performance:** Stream-based updates are more efficient than constant polling
2. **Improved UX:** No more multiple sheets or UI glitches
3. **Reliable Statistics:** All statistics are properly captured and displayed
4. **Clean Code:** Proper separation of concerns and state management
5. **Maintainability:** Better error handling and debug logging

## Additional Notes

- The stream-based approach ensures that progress updates are received in real-time
- The implementation properly handles cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Debug logging has been enhanced to help troubleshoot any remaining issues
- The fixes maintain compatibility with the existing native Swift implementation
