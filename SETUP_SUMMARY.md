# Flutter wBlock Plugin Setup Summary

## What Has Been Created

I've successfully created a complete Flutter plugin that clones the wBlock Swift app functionality. Here's what's been implemented:

### Plugin Structure (`flutter_wblock_plugin/`)

1. **Core Plugin Files**
   - `pubspec.yaml` - Plugin configuration
   - `lib/flutter_wblock_plugin.dart` - Main plugin interface with all method channels
   - `lib/flutter_wblock_plugin_platform_interface.dart` - Platform interface for testing
   - `README.md` - Documentation
   - `LICENSE` - MIT License
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore file

2. **iOS Plugin Implementation**
   - `ios/flutter_wblock_plugin.podspec` - iOS podspec with wBlockCoreService dependency
   - `ios/Classes/FlutterWblockPlugin.swift` - iOS method channel implementation

3. **macOS Plugin Implementation**
   - `macos/flutter_wblock_plugin.podspec` - macOS podspec with wBlockCoreService dependency
   - `macos/Classes/FlutterWblockPlugin.swift` - macOS method channel implementation

4. **Test Files**
   - `test/flutter_wblock_plugin_test.dart` - Unit tests for the plugin

### Example App (`flutter_wblock_plugin/example/`)

1. **Core App Files**
   - `pubspec.yaml` - Example app dependencies
   - `lib/main.dart` - Main app entry point with platform-specific UI

2. **Managers** (Dart implementations that communicate with native)
   - `lib/managers/app_filter_manager.dart` - Filter management
   - `lib/managers/user_script_manager.dart` - User script management

3. **Models**
   - `lib/models/filter_list.dart` - FilterList model and categories
   - `lib/models/user_script.dart` - UserScript model

4. **Views** (Complete UI replicas of Swift views)
   - `lib/views/content_view.dart` - Main content view
   - `lib/views/stat_card.dart` - Statistics card widget
   - `lib/views/add_filter_list_view.dart` - Add custom filter dialog
   - `lib/views/logs_view.dart` - Application logs view
   - `lib/views/user_script_manager_view.dart` - User scripts management
   - `lib/views/update_popup_view.dart` - Update available popup
   - `lib/views/missing_filters_view.dart` - Missing filters view
   - `lib/views/apply_changes_progress_view.dart` - Progress view
   - `lib/views/whitelist_manager_view.dart` - Whitelist management
   - `lib/views/onboarding_view.dart` - Onboarding flow

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Update Podspecs
The `ios/flutter_wblock_plugin.podspec` and `macos/flutter_wblock_plugin.podspec` files already contain:
```ruby
s.dependency 'wBlockCoreService', :git => 'https://github.com/amosogra/wBlockCoreService_Package.git', :tag => '1.0.0'
```

You can now safely delete the `wBlockCoreService` folders from the `ios` and `macos` directories as instructed.

### 2. Run Flutter Commands
```bash
cd flutter_wblock_plugin/example
flutter create . --platforms=ios,macos
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install
cd ../macos && pod install
```

### 3. Configure in Xcode

#### For iOS:
1. Open `example/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Set Bundle Identifier to `syferlab.wBlock`
3. Set App Group to `group.syferlab.wBlock` in capabilities
4. Add the Web Extension and Content Blocker Extension targets
5. Configure entitlements for app groups

#### For macOS:
1. Open `example/macos/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Set Bundle Identifier to `syferlab.wBlock`
3. Set App Group to `group.syferlab.wBlock` in capabilities
4. Add the Web Extension and Content Blocker Extension targets
5. Configure entitlements for app groups

### 4. Add Extensions
You'll need to manually add the Safari Web Extension and Content Blocker Extension in Xcode as mentioned in your instructions.

### 5. Test the App
```bash
flutter run -d iphone  # For iOS
flutter run -d macos   # For macOS
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Complete UI Clone**: All views from the Swift app have been recreated in Flutter
2. **Native Logic Preservation**: All business logic remains in Swift (AppFilterManager, UserScriptManager, etc.)
3. **Method Channel Communication**: Flutter UI communicates with native Swift code
4. **Platform-Specific UI**: Cupertino widgets for iOS, Material for macOS
5. **State Management**: Using Provider pattern for reactive updates
6. **Onboarding Flow**: Complete with blocking level selection and user script configuration

## Architecture

```
Flutter UI (Dart) <--> Method Channel <--> Native Swift Logic
                                           |
                                           +--> wBlockCoreService Package
                                           +--> Safari Extensions
```

The plugin maintains complete separation of concerns as requested, with Flutter handling only the UI while all filtering logic remains in the native Swift code.
