## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Progress Sheet
✅ Opens only once (no duplicate sheets)
✅ Updates smoothly without flickering
✅ Shows real-time progress percentage
✅ Displays current processing stage
✅ Can be dismissed at any time after completion

### Statistics Display
✅ **Overall Statistics** shows:
  - Source Rules (original filter rules count)
  - Safari Rules (converted rules count)
  - Conversion Time (e.g., "2.5s")
  - Reload Time (e.g., "1.2s")

✅ **Category Statistics** shows:
  - Each category with rules (e.g., Ads, Privacy, Security)
  - Rule count for each category
  - Warning icon if category is approaching limit
  - Proper colors for each category

### Sheet Management
✅ No multiple sheets opening
✅ No sheet rebuilding during progress
✅ Dismiss button always functional
✅ Proper cleanup when sheets close

## Debug Output

To verify the fixes are working, check the debug console for messages like:
```
Updated source rules count: 750000
Updated last rule count: 500000
Category Ads (ads): 150000 rules
Category Privacy (privacy): 200000 rules
Updated rule counts by category: 7 categories
Updated conversion time: 3.2s
Updated reload time: 1.5s
Apply complete. Final statistics:
- Last rule count: 500000
- Source rules: 750000
- Categories: 7
- Conversion time: 3.2s
- Reload time: 1.5s
```

## Common Issues That Should Be Fixed

❌ ~~Only one statistic showing after updates~~ → ✅ All statistics now display
❌ ~~Category Statistics not appearing~~ → ✅ Categories now show properly
❌ ~~Multiple sheets opening/rebuilding~~ → ✅ Single sheet with stream updates
❌ ~~Dismiss button not working~~ → ✅ Dismiss works immediately
❌ ~~Progress not completing properly~~ → ✅ Progress reaches 100% and shows results

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the debug console for error messages
2. Verify the native Swift code is sending the expected data format
3. Ensure the Flutter app is properly connected to the native plugin
4. Try a full rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run`

## Performance Improvements

The new implementation provides:
- 🚀 Faster progress updates via streams
- 💾 Better memory management with proper cleanup
- 🎯 More accurate progress tracking
- 📊 Complete statistics capture
- 🔄 Smooth UI updates without rebuilds
